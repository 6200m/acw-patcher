	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ \n
	+ In this game,\z{806,5} you can\n
	+ communicate with friends\n
	+ by connecting to \z{8ff,100}other Wii\n
	+ systems\z{8ff,0} via \z{8ff,200}RiiConnect24\z{8ff,0}.\n
	+ Using this feature, you can\n
	+ send letters directly to friends\n
	+ who are registered on your\n
	+ \z{8ff,200}Friend Roster\z{8ff,0}...\n
	+ Or you can send messages to\n
	+ the \z{8ff,200}Wii Message Boards\z{8ff,0} of\n
	+ friends whose \z{8ff,200}Wii Numbers\z{8ff,0}\n
	+ you have registered.\n
	+ On top of that, \z{806,a}out of the\n
	+ blue, your friends' neighbors\n
	+ can move to your town and\n
	+ become your neighbors\z{806,5}.\z{806,5}.\z{806,5}.\n
	+ They might share stories\n
	+ about happenings in your\n
	+ friends' towns\z{806,5}.\z{806,5}.\z{806,5}.\n
	+ \n
	+ Even when you aren't playing,\z{806,a}\n
	+ it can feel like your towns\n
	+ are connected.\n
	+ \n
	+ Not only that, \z{806,a}but you can\n
	+ also periodically receive\n
	+ letters and presents from\n
	+ Nintendo.\n
