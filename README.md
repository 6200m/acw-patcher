# Animal Crossing Wii - Wiimmfi+RC24 patcher

This patcher is for Animal Crossing Wii, and will patch for both Wiimmfi's URLs and "Nintendo WFC", aswell as add RiiConnect24's key into your ISO.  
You will need to use DNS `185.82.21.64` and delete `wc24pubk.mod` from your savedata (instructions will come later)  

## Usage
Place your image in the folder with the WBFS/ISO and run the create-image script; type in your region (Accepts: PAL/NTSC-U/NTSC-J/NTSC-K) and hit enter.

## To Do
- [ ] Get other language translations (see https://github.com/PokeAcer549/acw-patcher/issues/1 )
- [ ] Find more offsets for patch keys
- [ ] Add how to remove public key from savedata
- [ ] Patch URLs to remove requirement of DNS (need to contact Wiimm)
- [ ] Make BMG list global
