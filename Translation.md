## Translation

For Translating (see https://github.com/PokeAcer549/acw-patcher/issues/1 ), you will need to change the text:  

"Nintendo WFC", "Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection" or similar with "Wiimmfi".  
"WiiConnect24" or similar with "RiiConnect24".  

Look in https://github.com/PokeAcer549/acw-patcher/tree/master/BMGs for the TXT files: **DO NOT CHANGE ANY MESSAGE OR INFO NOT RELATED.**
Create a PR, adding your translation in; Once v1.3 exists it will read from that BMGs folder.
